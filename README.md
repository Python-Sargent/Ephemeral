# Ephemeral
A Multiplayer Pygame RPG Game.

A work in progress, multiplayer and serverside stuff is not up and running yet.

## How to run

### Dependencies

#### Pygame
Get the pygame module (I'm running pygame-ce, but pygame should work, if not look up how to install pygame-ce on your system)

In your terminal of choice run `pip install pygame` follow any instructions (make sure pip is installed).

### Running

To play, just run `menu.py` (this is likely to break in some versions as I'm pushing straight to main while developing for version 1).

## Discord Server
This game is not entirely ready for contributors.
Once a production structure is set up and the goals are more set in place, I plan to decide on how to move forward with the contribution side of things.\
However at this point in time I will be developing this personally, anyone is free to give ideas and feedback, sending me code to try out also works if ideas isn't you thing.

If you have ideas or want to talk about this game, there is a discord server.
You can also see updates and announcements on this server.
